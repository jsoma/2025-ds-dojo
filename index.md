## Working with PDFs

The best tool to use for working with PDFs is [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber). There are plenty of videos on YouTube about how to use it (although I haven't used them)

- [Notebooks from NICAR 2023](https://github.com/jsvine/nicar-2023-pdfplumber-workshop/tree/main/notebooks)
- [Notebooks from Lede 2024](https://github.com/jsvine/lede-2024/tree/main/pdf-parsing/notebooks)

You can also use [this interactive demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/wendys-llc/pdfplumber-demo) to test out the cropping/table selection.

## Automatic scraping

[Tutorial for an automatic scraper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNKxzkNpsko), although you'll need to change things a little bit to make it work with Playwright. You'll also want to make your repository **private** if it isn't data you'd like to make public! I recommend following the tutorial first **to learn how to do it**, then doing it with your "real" data separately.

## Deeper data analysis and text analysis

If you're interested in traditional analysis, you might want to try out [investigate.ai](https://investigate.ai/), a website I made that is a series of tutorials about data science for non-data-science people (journalists). It's from before ChatGPT, though, so it might not be the best answer these days. It can give you some ideas about things like regression and text analysis, though.
