1. Ask the LLM to do the homework again
2. Review what it's done... but we can't!
    - We're confused :(
3. Let's look at...
    - Variables
    - Running code vs code existing
    - Printing vs not printing
4. Functions and methods
    - .upper()
    - .reverse()
    - len(....)
    - median(...)
    - imports (stats)
