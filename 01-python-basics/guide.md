# Setup

There are many, many ways to set up and run Python. Maybe you'll do it piece by piece yourself, or use plug-and-play with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), or stick to the cloud with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

We're going to be using [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop).

To find instructions on using JupyterLab Desktop, check [the class slides](data-dojo-intro.pdf)
